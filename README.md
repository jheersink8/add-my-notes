# Note Taker

GitHub Repo: https://github.com/jheersink8/add-my-notes

Deployed Site: https://add-my-notes.onrender.com/ 

## Description

This tool is used for users to make simple notes and have the stored values persist so that they can be opened from other devices. The values are stored on a server using Express.js. This tool demonstrates a working knowledge of the following tools: 

- Node.js
- Express.js
- The get, post, and delete Express.js methods
- Destructors 
- Writing to and reading from JSON files

## Usage
After visiting the deployed website link posted above, the user will be presented with a display of the site's home screen. After clicking "Get Started," they'll be redirected to the Note Taker storage site. Here, they can do the following: 
- Enter new notes into the right side of the screen by clicking on the stand in text "Note Title" and "Note Text"
- Save new notes (which will appear on the left side of the screen)
- Click on old notes to have the "New Note" button appear (and thus create more notes)
- Click the delete button to delete any note
